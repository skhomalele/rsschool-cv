## About me
I set myself the goal of taking your courses and finally starting to work in my chosen profession. I am good at selling anything (ideas, things). I have no programming experience at all. I'll be honest, I'm very lazy, but I have the desire to learn something new. For the first time in a long time, I strain my brain so hard, I hear it creak. I also joke a lot, especially when I'm nervous.
